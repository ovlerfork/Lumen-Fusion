</div>

Lumina is a fork of [Lumen](https://github.com/trollzem/Lumen) (originally [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine)) that fixes macOS support from the ground up. Stream your Mac's display to any [Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org/) client — TV, phone, tablet, another PC — with native system audio, automatic virtual display management, and hardware-accelerated encoding.

Tested on **M4 Mac Mini (16GB RAM)** — **1ms encode-to-network latency** over local network with H.264 VideoToolbox encoding.

---

## About this Fork

Lumina originated as a fork of [Lumen](https://github.com/trollzem/Lumen). It builds upon Lumen's foundation by resolving lingering controller issues and integrating relevant upstream enhancements from the original Sunshine repository. The project was rebranded to **Lumina** to reflect its divergence from Lumen, as it incorporates further independent updates, fixes, and improvements.

---

## Why Lumina?

Upstream Sunshine has significant issues on macOS:

| Problem | Sunshine (upstream) | Lumina |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| **Build on macOS** | Fails with C++ toolchain errors on modern Xcode/CLT | Builds cleanly with automated dependency management |
| **System audio** | No capture — requires BlackHole virtual audio device | Native ScreenCaptureKit audio — zero-config, no extra software |
| **Virtual displays** | Manual setup with BetterDisplay ($15 app) | Automatic — creates/destroys virtual displays on connect/disconnect |
| **Gamepad support** | None on macOS | Virtual HID gamepad via IOHIDUserDevice (works with Dolphin, Steam, etc.) |
| **H.264 encoding** | All-IDR bug on Apple Silicon (every frame is a keyframe) | Fixed — proper P-frame generation, 3x bandwidth reduction |
| **Encoder performance** | Capture and encode on same thread | Parallel capture/encode pipeline |

---

## Features

- **Zero-config system audio** — ScreenCaptureKit captures all desktop audio natively. Core Audio Tap is available as an opt-in experiment with `audio_sink = audiotap`.

- **Automatic virtual displays** — When a Moonlight client connects, Lumina creates a virtual display matching the client's requested resolution and refresh rate (e.g., 4K@60Hz). When the last client disconnects, the virtual display is destroyed. No third-party display managers needed.

- **Hardware-accelerated encoding** — VideoToolbox H.264 and HEVC encoding with Apple Silicon hardware acceleration. H.264 at 1080p60 encodes in ~15ms on M4 (fits within the 16.67ms frame budget). HEVC available for higher quality at the cost of slightly higher latency (~18ms on M4).

- **Virtual gamepad** — Creates a system-wide virtual HID gamepad that appears as a real controller to any application. Works with SDL-based games, Dolphin Emulator, Steam, Ryujinx, and more. Requires one-time security configuration (see [Gamepad Setup](#gamepad-setup-optional)).

- **Low latency** — Measured 1ms encode-to-network latency on local network with H.264 VideoToolbox on M4 Mac Mini.

---

## Requirements

- **macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later** — required for CGVirtualDisplay API
- **Apple Silicon Mac** (M1/M2/M3/M4) — ARM64 only
- **Moonlight client** on your target device — [moonlight-stream.org](https://moonlight-stream.org/)

---

## Quick Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jayl-dev/Lumina.git
cd Lumina
./install.sh
```

To copy an existing Sunshine configuration, including Web UI credentials,
certificates, applications, and Moonlight pairings, use:

```bash
./install.sh --import-sunshine-config
```

This copies `~/.config/sunshine/` into `~/.config/lumina/` without changing
the original Sunshine files. Existing Lumina files are not overwritten.

The install script handles everything:
1. Checks macOS version and architecture
2. Installs Homebrew (if not present)
3. Installs all build dependencies with correct versions:
   - `cmake` — build system
   - `boost` — C++ utility libraries (Asio, Log, Process, Locale)
   - `pkg-config` — library path resolution
   - `openssl@3` — TLS/SSL for HTTPS web UI and RTSP
   - `opus` — audio codec for streaming
   - `llvm` — Clang/LLVM toolchain
   - `doxygen` — documentation generation (build requirement)
   - `graphviz` — documentation graphs (build requirement)
   - `node` — web UI build (Vue 3 + Vite)
   - `icu4c@78` — Unicode support (Boost.Locale dependency)
   - `miniupnpc` — UPnP port mapping for NAT traversal
   - `qtbase` / `qtsvg` — cross-platform system tray runtime
4. Detects the correct macOS SDK path and C++ header location
5. Configures cmake with all necessary flags (see [macOS Build Fixes](#macos-build-fixes) for why this is needed)
6. Builds from source with all CPU cores
7. Installs the binary, virtual display helper, and assets to `~/.local/share/lumina/`
8. Sets up default configuration in `~/.config/lumina/`
9. Creates a `lumina` launch command in `~/.local/bin/`

After installation, grant these macOS permissions when prompted:
- **Screen Recording** (System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording)
- **Accessibility** (System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility)

---

## Usage

### Start Lumina

```bash
lumina
```

Or if `~/.local/bin` isn't in your PATH:

```bash
~/.local/bin/lumina
```

### Running the Command-Line ZIP

The macOS ZIP distribution contains `bin/lumina`, `bin/vd_helper`, the assets,
the Qt tray runtime, and `hid_entitlements.plist`. Its relocatable runtime is
ad-hoc signed without the restricted HID entitlement; it is not Developer ID
signed or notarized. It can be used without changing macOS security settings:
streaming, the admin web UI, audio, keyboard, mouse, and virtual-display
features continue to work. Virtual HID gamepad emulation is the only feature
that requires the optional local re-signing and security configuration in
[Gamepad Setup](#gamepad-setup-optional).

If Gatekeeper has added a quarantine attribute to the extracted archive, remove
it from the extracted directory before launching:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine Lumina
cd Lumina
./bin/lumina
```

Removing quarantine does not enable virtual gamepad support; it only permits the
unsigned command-line binaries to launch.

### Pair with Moonlight

1. Open the Lumina web UI at **https://localhost:47990**
2. Log in with the credentials you set during installation
3. Open Moonlight on your client device
4. Moonlight will discover Lumina automatically via mDNS
5. Enter the PIN shown in Moonlight into the Lumina web UI
6. Connect — a virtual display is created automatically at your client's resolution

### Stop Lumina

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal, or quit from the system tray icon.

---

## Configuration

Config files live in `~/.config/lumina/`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `sunshine.conf` | Runtime settings (bitrate, audio source, encoder, etc.) |
| `sunshine_state.json` | Web UI credentials and paired Moonlight clients |
| `sunshine.log` | Runtime log |
| `apps.json` | Applications visible in Moonlight's app list |
| `credentials/` | TLS certificates for HTTPS and client pairing (auto-generated) |

At startup, Lumina rotates `sunshine.log` and retains up to five previous logs
as `sunshine.log.1` through `sunshine.log.5`.

### Key Settings (sunshine.conf)

```ini
# Audio source — "system" uses ScreenCaptureKit (recommended)
audio_sink = system

# Maximum streaming bitrate in kbps
max_bitrate = 80000

# Virtual display — disabled by default
virtual_display = disabled

# Optional packet-size cap for low-MTU links; 0 disables the cap
packetsize = 0

# UPnP port mapping for remote access
upnp = enabled
```

`packetsize` can lower a Moonlight client's requested video packet size to avoid
fragmentation over a VPN or other low-MTU path. Valid values are `0` (disabled)
or `200` through `65535`; values above `1456` may require jumbo frames. A useful
starting point is the path's maximum UDP payload minus 16 bytes.

### Streaming Performance Diagnostics

For temporary capture, encoder, FEC, network-send, and Moonlight loss metrics,
see [Streaming performance diagnostics](docs/streaming-performance-logging.md).
Build this developer-only profiler with `./dev.sh performance`, then enable its
runtime flag directly in `sunshine.conf`. Its dedicated log channel works while
the normal log level remains set to `error`.

### Experimental Core Audio Tap

Lumina includes an isolated Core Audio Tap backend for comparison with the
ScreenCaptureKit path. It is opt-in; `audio_sink = system` remains the default
and recommended backend. On macOS 14 or later, use:

```ini
audio_sink = audiotap
```

Then restart Lumina. Compare the two backends for:

| Area | ScreenCaptureKit (`system`) | Core Audio Tap (`audiotap`, experimental) |
|---|---|---|
| Latency | Stable minimal SCStream audio path | Potentially lower, direct Core Audio callback |
| System audio | Reliable with Screen Recording permission | Requires macOS 14+ and Core Audio tap permission/security support |
| Microphone mixing | Existing Lumina microphone/device path | Captures the system mix; use a configured device when microphone input is needed |
| Reconnects | Existing ScreenCaptureKit restart handling | Aggregate-device/tap lifecycle; test sleep, display changes, and reconnects carefully |

If `audiotap` cannot initialize, Lumina logs the failure and does not silently
switch backends, keeping comparisons unambiguous. Restore `audio_sink = system`
to return to the production ScreenCaptureKit path.

### Adding Apps (apps.json)

Apps appear in Moonlight's launcher. Example for Dolphin Emulator:

```json
{
  "name": "Dolphin Emulator",
  "detached": [
    "~/.config/lumina/scripts/launch_dolphin.sh"
  ],
  "prep-cmd": [
    {
      "do": "",
      "undo": "osascript -e 'tell application \"Dolphin\" to quit'"
    }
  ]
}
```

Launch scripts can use the virtual display position file (`/tmp/sunshine_vd_id`) to move app windows to the streaming display automatically. See `scripts/launch_dolphin.sh` for an example.

---

## Gamepad Setup (Optional)

Virtual gamepad support requires a one-time security configuration because it uses Apple's IOHIDUserDevice API with a restricted entitlement. **This is only needed if you want gamepad/controller support.** Keyboard and mouse input work without this step.

### Why This Is Needed

macOS restricts the creation of virtual HID devices to prevent malicious software from injecting fake input. Lumina creates a virtual gamepad that appears as a real USB controller to the system — this requires the `com.apple.developer.hid.virtual.device` entitlement, which Apple only allows with AMFI (Apple Mobile File Integrity) disabled.

**SIP (System Integrity Protection) does NOT need to be disabled** — only AMFI. This is a less invasive change that specifically allows ad-hoc signed binaries to use restricted entitlements.

### Steps

1. **Shut down your Mac** completely (not restart)

2. **Boot into Recovery Mode:**
   - **Apple Silicon:** Hold the **power button** until "Loading startup options" appears
   - Select **Options** > **Continue**

3. **Open Terminal** from the **Utilities** menu in Recovery Mode

4. **Disable AMFI** (allows restricted entitlements on ad-hoc signed binaries):
   ```bash
   nvram boot-args="amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1"
   ```

5. **Restart** your Mac normally

6. **Sign the Lumina binaries** with the HID entitlement:
   ```bash
   codesign --sign - --entitlements ~/.local/share/lumina/hid_entitlements.plist --force ~/.local/share/lumina/lumina
   codesign --sign - --force ~/.local/share/lumina/vd_helper
   ```

   For a ZIP extracted in the current directory, use:
   ```bash
   codesign --force --sign - --entitlements hid_entitlements.plist bin/vd_helper
   codesign --force --sign - --entitlements hid_entitlements.plist bin/lumina
   ```

That's it. The gamepad will now appear in any application as a generic USB controller. You can verify it's working by connecting from Moonlight with a controller and checking System Information > USB.

### Important Notes

- **AMFI disable persists across reboots** — you only need to do this once
- **Re-sign after every rebuild** — if you rebuild from source, run the `codesign` commands again
- **The `lumina` launcher auto-signs on every launch** — the manual step above is only needed if you bypass the launcher
- **To re-enable AMFI later:** boot into Recovery Mode and run `nvram -d boot-args`
- **Without AMFI disabled, Lumina still works fully** — you just won't have gamepad support. Keyboard, mouse, virtual displays, audio, and all other features work normally.
- **The ZIP does not contain the restricted HID entitlement.** Lumina still launches normally after any quarantine is removed; only virtual HID gamepad emulation is unavailable until you locally re-sign it as shown above.
- **Security note:** Disabling AMFI reduces one layer of macOS security. Only do this if you understand the implications and need gamepad support.

## Building From Source

If you want to build manually instead of using `install.sh`:

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Homebrew if not already installed
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install all build dependencies
brew install cmake boost pkg-config openssl@3 opus llvm doxygen graphviz node icu4c@78 miniupnpc qtbase qtsvg
```

### Build

```bash
cd Lumina

# Detect macOS SDK path
SDK_PATH=$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)

mkdir -p build && cd build

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DBUILD_WERROR=ON \
  -DHOMEBREW_ALLOW_FETCHCONTENT=ON \
  -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=$(brew --prefix openssl@3) \
  -DSUNSHINE_ASSETS_DIR=sunshine/assets \
  -DSUNSHINE_BUILD_HOMEBREW=ON \
  -DSUNSHINE_ENABLE_TRAY=ON \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$(brew --prefix qtbase);$(brew --prefix qtsvg)" \
  -DQt6Svg_DIR="$(brew --prefix qtsvg)/lib/cmake/Qt6Svg" \
  -DBOOST_USE_STATIC=OFF \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT="$SDK_PATH" \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-nostdinc++ -cxx-isystem $SDK_PATH/usr/include/c++/v1 -std=gnu++2b -I$(brew --prefix openssl@3)/include" \
  -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-I$(brew --prefix openssl@3)/include" \
  ..

make sunshine web-ui vd_helper -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
```

### Run

```bash
cd build
./lumina
```

## Networking

| Port | Protocol | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| 47984-47990 | TCP | Control, RTSP, Web UI (HTTPS) |
| 47998-48010 | UDP | Video/audio streaming |
| 47990 | HTTPS | Web configuration UI |

Lumina supports **UPnP** for automatic port mapping. For manual port forwarding, open the ports above on your router.

mDNS/DNS-SD is used for automatic discovery on the local network — Moonlight will find Lumina without any configuration.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "No screen capture permission" | Grant Screen Recording in System Settings > Privacy & Security |
| No audio in stream | Ensure `audio_sink = system` in sunshine.conf and Screen Recording permission is granted |
| Black screen / no video | Check that the virtual display was created (look for "Created virtual display" in logs) |
| Gamepad not detected | Ensure AMFI is disabled and binary is signed (see [Gamepad Setup](#gamepad-setup-optional)) |
| High latency (>5ms) | Use H.264 instead of HEVC — H.264 encodes faster on Apple Silicon (~15ms vs ~18ms for 1080p) |
| Build fails with C++ include errors | The install script handles this automatically. If building manually, ensure `-nostdinc++` and `-cxx-isystem` flags point to your SDK's C++ headers (see [macOS Build Fixes](#macos-build-fixes)). |
| `libminiupnpc` not found | Run `brew install miniupnpc` |
| App opens on wrong display | Launch scripts should use `/tmp/sunshine_vd_id` to find the virtual display position. See `scripts/launch_dolphin.sh`. |

### Viewing Logs

Lumina outputs logs to the terminal. To save logs to a file:

```bash
lumina 2>&1 | tee ~/lumina.log
```

### Virtual Display System (CGVirtualDisplay)

Virtual displays are disabled by default. On macOS, enable them from **Web UI →
Configuration → Audio/Video → Virtual Display**, select **Enabled**, and save.
The change applies to the next stream. Alternatively, add the following to
`~/.config/lumina/sunshine.conf` and restart Lumina:

```ini
virtual_display = enabled
```

Lumina then uses Apple's private `CGVirtualDisplay` API (available on macOS 14+)
to create a display on demand at the resolution and refresh rate requested by
Moonlight. The virtual display is removed when streaming stops. This eliminates
the need for third-party tools like BetterDisplay.

**Why a subprocess?** CGVirtualDisplay doesn't work when created directly in the Lumina process. The TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) framework and WindowServer registration require a clean process context. Lumina spawns `vd_helper` as a subprocess that:

1. Creates a `CGVirtualDisplayDescriptor` with the requested resolution
2. Creates display modes — both native and retina variants (e.g., 3840x2160 native + 1920x1080@2x)
3. Creates a `CGVirtualDisplay` object and applies the modes
4. Activates the display via `SLSConfigureDisplayEnabled` (SkyLight private function)
5. Forces extend mode — macOS may auto-mirror new displays, hiding them from `CGGetActiveDisplayList`
6. Switches to native 1x mode via `CGDisplaySetDisplayMode` to avoid retina 2x scaling at 4K
7. Writes the display ID to stdout (read by Lumina) and `/tmp/sunshine_vd_id` (read by app launch scripts)
8. Stays alive holding the display reference until SIGTERM

**Physical dimensions matter.** CGVirtualDisplay rejects displays where the pixel density exceeds a threshold relative to the declared physical size. Lumina uses a fixed 27-inch equivalent (597x336mm) which supports up to 4K resolution without rejection.

### ScreenCaptureKit Audio Capture

macOS has no public API for directly capturing system audio output. Previously, this required routing audio through a virtual loopback device like BlackHole. Lumina uses ScreenCaptureKit's audio capture capability instead:

1. Creates a minimal SCStream targeting a 64x64 pixel region at 1fps (minimal CPU/GPU usage)
2. Enables `capturesAudio = YES` on the stream configuration
3. Sets `excludesCurrentProcessAudio = YES` to avoid feedback loops
4. Receives non-interleaved Float32 stereo PCM at 48kHz
5. Interleaves the L/R channels and writes to a TPCircularBuffer
6. The Opus encoder reads from the ring buffer for network delivery

This approach requires **Screen Recording permission** (which is needed for video capture anyway) and works on macOS 12.3+.

### VideoToolbox H.264 Fix

On Apple Silicon (confirmed on M4), setting `ReferenceBufferCount=1` (Sunshine's `max_ref_frames=1`) on VideoToolbox's H.264 encoder causes catastrophic behavior: **every frame becomes an IDR keyframe**. P-frames are never produced.

The impact:
- Each frame is ~300KB instead of ~30KB (10x larger)
- Actual bitrate is 2-3x the configured maximum
- Moonlight reports 30%+ "frames dropped by network"
- Stuttering and frame drops despite low latency

Lumina removes this option for H.264. HEVC is unaffected and retains `max_ref_frames=1`. This single fix dramatically improves streaming quality on Apple Silicon.

### Virtual HID Gamepad

Lumina creates a virtual USB gamepad using `IOHIDUserDeviceCreateWithProperties()`. The device appears as a generic USB gamepad with:

- **VID/PID:** `0x1209`/`0x5853` (generic, not matching any known controller)
- **Usage Page:** Generic Desktop (0x01), Usage: Joystick (0x04)
- **Buttons:** 16 digital buttons mapped to standard gamepad layout
- **Axes:** 4 analog axes (2 sticks) + 2 triggers

**Why generic VID/PID?** SDL (used by most games/emulators) has a list of known Xbox/PlayStation VID/PIDs. When SDL sees a known VID/PID, it assumes the macOS Game Controller framework handles it and skips its own IOKit HID backend. Since virtual HID devices get `IOHIDEventDummyService` (not recognized by Game Controller framework), this creates a dead zone — SDL won't see the controller through either path. Using a generic VID/PID forces SDL to use its IOKit HID backend directly. Games and emulators like Dolphin can then manually map the buttons.

### macOS Build Fixes

Building upstream Sunshine on modern macOS (15+) with Command Line Tools fails due to several issues:

1. **Empty C++ include directory:** The Command Line Tools install at `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/include/c++/v1/` contains only a `__cxx_version` marker file. The actual C++ standard library headers are in the SDK at `$SDK_PATH/usr/include/c++/v1/`.

2. **Fix:** CMake flags `-nostdinc++ -cxx-isystem $SDK_PATH/usr/include/c++/v1` tell the compiler to ignore the empty default path and use the SDK headers instead.

3. **OpenSSL headers:** Homebrew installs OpenSSL to a non-standard location (`/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/`). The upstream CMake configuration doesn't add this to the include path on macOS, requiring explicit `-I` flags in both `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` and `CMAKE_C_FLAGS`.

4. **Opus include path:** The code uses `#include <opus/opus_multistream.h>` but the Opus pkg-config reports the directory containing the headers directly (without the `opus/` subdirectory). Fixed in `common.cmake` by using the parent directory.

5. **`CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT`:** Must be set explicitly to the current SDK path to avoid picking up a stale or mismatched SDK.

The install script detects all of these automatically and configures the build correctly.

### Parallel Encoding Pipeline

Lumina enables `PARALLEL_ENCODING` for the VideoToolbox encoder, which decouples the capture and encode threads. Without this flag, frame capture blocks until the previous frame finishes encoding. With it enabled:

- Capture thread delivers frames to a queue continuously
- Encode thread processes frames from the queue independently
- This eliminates frame drops caused by encoder stalls and improves overall throughput
